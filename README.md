# DSA Daily Grind

Welcome to the DSA repository—a common ground for peers to track their day-to-day work and stay motivated by seeing each other's progress and consistency in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

## Guidelines

1.  **Maintain Your Own Repository**
    * **Your Folder:** Each participant must maintain their own repository.
    * **Structure:** Create a **root folder** named after your GitHub username.
    * **Daily Folders:** Inside your root folder, create folders for each day (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
    * **Daily README:** Each daily folder must contain a `README.md` that documents your work for that day.
2.  **Daily README Requirements**
    * **Goal & Timeline:** In each daily README, clearly state your goal for the day and the timeline you have set for yourself.
    * **Progress & Challenges:** Share your current progress, any challenges faced, and lessons learned.
    * **Additional Resources:** Optionally, include code snippets, resources, or notes that might help others.
3.  **Social Engagement**
    * **Learn & Inspire:** This is not just about personal growth—it’s a social exercise. Browse through peers' daily updates to learn from their work.
    * **Feedback:** Engage with your peers by offering constructive feedback and sharing insights.
4.  **Extra Motivation**
    * **LinkedIn Post:** If you're ready to push yourself further:
        * Write a LinkedIn post about your daily improvements.
        * Include a link to your current improvement work (the relevant day’s folder in your repo).
    * **Sharing:** Share the LinkedIn post link either in your daily README or on your preferred discussion channel.

## Why This Matters

* **Accountability:** Keeping a daily log helps build discipline and track progress.
* **Community Learning:** By seeing different approaches and problem-solving techniques, you can expand your own understanding.
* **Motivation:** Public sharing and peer validation can serve as a strong motivator to keep going.

## Getting Started

* **Fork or Clone** this repository.
* **Create Your Folder:** Set up a folder with your GitHub username as the root.
* **Start Daily Logs:** Begin creating day-named folders and add your daily README documenting your journey.

Embrace the daily grind, share your progress, and be part of a supportive community that’s all about learning and growing together in DSA. Happy coding!
